# steplator
Templates are very easy for coding with different data. There might be a variable missing and a whole parapraph should disappear? A traditional way of replacing with vars or function callbacks is still a hassle, because at long texts it need a long time to output the first chars. SO the function do not replace it just iterates through the chars of your string.

Features:
* possible to define char for beginning and ending of variables and conditions [[show only when{{test_title}}isset]]
* possible to define custom chars and functions if you need something else as replace or conditional
* output directly step by step to browser, after each replacement is done
* or output back to the var
* nest your expressions
* extendable for your needs
